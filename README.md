## Toy Problems
This collection of Python functions that address various programming challenges, each designed to test different coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

### Problem 1
1. Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
This challenge involves converting a given 12-hour time (hour, minute, and AM/PM period) to the 24-hour time format.
By convention, noon is 12:00 pm, and midnight is 12:00 am.
On 12-hours clock, there is no 0 hour, and time just after midnight is denoted as am.

### Problem 2
2. Two numbers are positive
In this challenge, we determine whether exactly two out of three given integers are positive.
It takes three integers a, b, and c as arguments, and returns True if exactly two of of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False - otherwise.


### Problem 3
3.  Consonant value
This challenge calculates the highest value of consonant substrings in a given string, where consonants are letters of the alphabet except for "aeiou."
Given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, returns the highest value of consonant substrings
